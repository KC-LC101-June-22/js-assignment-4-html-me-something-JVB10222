					<h2>Basketball</h2>
					<p id="testP" class="funParagraph">Basketball was a heavy influence on me growing up. It gave me structure and discipline in my everday life. If I didnt play consistently I would feel inadequate against good oppenents and it gave me a reason to compete against myself. We are our biggest critiques in life and basketball made me recognize to get out of my own way and just try things that my body and mind was just not comfortable with. It gave me confidence to try and fail.</p>

					<h2>Woodworking and Building</h2>
					<p>Woodworking is a hobby of mind that I am proud to say I am proficient in. I can build a number of things out of wood as well as repair fixtures within my own home. I was a carpenter for a few years professionally, but found myself starting to hate work as I wanted to build and create at my own pace. I have made my own adjustable-height desk, shelving units, &amp; a number of small projects in repairs. I would like to make a <a href="https://magicmirror.builders/">magic mirror</a> which if you break it down its basically a smart display behind a mirror that can give you information as you get dressed in the mornings.</p>

					<h2>Tech Industry</h2>
					<p>I want to work in technology. I have always loved to be around and learn about technology, but have never had an opportunity to work in an environment where people are interested in the same things as me. I have taken classes about development and have been able to dip my toes into that water, but there was not many resources that I was aware of where I could begin this journey. It was not a reality until recently when I started to research programs like LaunchCode that provided these connections that would otherwise be very difficult to get your foot in the door without a degree. I will work in the tech industry, I believe I am capable of learning and surpassing the necessary skills to start as junior developer. My goal is to one day be able to teach what I know about development to someone with the same outlook on technology as myself.</p>

					<h2>Working For Myself</h2>
					<div>
                  <p>I hope to one day be able to help smaller companies have a larger presence online. As an experienced developer I hope to be able to provide my services as an entrepreneur and lend my skills building websites and tools for small companies that provide to the community. It is hard to get the latest resources online as a small business and I would like to make my community more up-to-date by providing websites that use todays common practices, so that the everday individual can give back to the community </p>
